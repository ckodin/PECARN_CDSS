# PECARN_CDSS

This repository contains the files used to create a clinical decision support tool for the PECARN Pediatric Head Injury/Trauma Algorithm. The tool was written in [GDL-2 language](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/CDS/latest/GDL2.html). 

Archetypes were reused from the openEHR repository where possible, and 3 additional archetypes were created (see archetypes folder).
